## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a software engineer with **Javascript** / **Typescript** specialization. Currently I'm dealing mostly with **React** library but actually it's not my only tech stack. In my career I tried various libraries that were (or still are :D ) associated with the world of web - JQuery (anyone remember this lib?!), AngularJS/Angular, Vue, Express etc.


## ðŸ›  Skills

**Main stack**: Javascript, Typescript, React

**Related technologies**: NextJS, Cypress, Jest, TailwindCSS, GCP, Docker, Jenkins, Grafana

**Experience also with**: AngularJS/Angular, Vue, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, Java
